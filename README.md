Introduction to Elevator Simulation Code:

In modern urban environments, elevators are ubiquitous, silently ferrying people between floors of buildings with remarkable efficiency and safety. Behind this seemingly simple operation lies a complex system of controls, algorithms, and sensors designed to optimize passenger movement and ensure operational reliability.

The elevator simulation code presented here aims to replicate a simplified version of this intricate system. It models the behavior of an elevator within a building, focusing on key functionalities such as:

Control Logic: Simulating how elevators decide which floor to travel to next based on passenger requests and optimizing for minimal waiting times. 

Passenger Interaction: Managing the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers at different floors, ensuring smooth and safe transitions.

Safety Protocols: Implementing basic safety measures such as door operation timings and emergency procedures. with type a word "HELP" 

User Interface: Providing a simple interface for users to interact with the simulated elevator system, making requests and observing the elevator's movements.
